A interactive visualization tool for pathfinding algorithms implemented with React. Watch Dijkstra's algorithm in action as it finds the shortest path between nodes on a grid!


## 🌟 Features

- 🧭 **Dijkstra's Algorithm** visualization with optimal pathfinding
- 🎨 **Interactive grid** with dynamic node manipulation
- 🖱️ **Click-and-drag** wall creation
- 🌈 **Animated transitions** for visited nodes and shortest path
- 🧹 **Clear grid** functionality for quick resets
- 📱 **Responsive design** that works on different screen sizes
- ⚡ **Optimized performance** with React state management

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS Animations
- HTML5 Canvas (potential future implementation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm (v6+)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shortest-path-visualizer.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
cd shortest-path-visualizer
npm install
```

3. **Run the development server**
```bash
npm start
```

4. **Open in browser**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Place Walls**
   - Click and drag to create barriers
   - Click existing walls to remove them

2. **Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm**
   - Click the "Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm" button
   - Watch the algorithm explore nodes (blue) and find the shortest path (yellow)

3. **Clear Grid**
   - Use the "Clear Grid" button to reset everything
   - Start nodes (green) and end nodes (red) remain fixed

4. **Interactive Features**
   - Hover over nodes to see coordinate tooltips
   - Real-time visualization updates
